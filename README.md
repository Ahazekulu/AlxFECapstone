This project is done as a fulfillment milestone to FE Engineering course given by ALX Africa.
1. The Project Idea
   There were project ideas listed by ALX to choose from. However, I decided to try authentic idea.
   By authentic, I mean the idea (even if not new) that I can develop myself from zero.
   I intended to build an app that enables users to register their contacts and new person they know
   in a grouped way and then schedule when to contact them through phone or physically.This is to help
   the user not to miss a relationship strengthening opportunity and to intentionally call or reach person.
3. Constraints
  I was new to the programming world when I join ALX. My experience was only some youtube videos I watched
  two years ago when I started fascinated by the web development world. So to develop this app as I wanted
  was somewhat difficult for me currently. But I think I have done well and I want to thank ALX for this.
  Now I am somewhat good at HTML CSS and JavaScript. ALX also introduced me to React Js, CSStailwind and other
  useful things that I will digout after I mastered JavaScript well.
  I am also full time employed at Bank and I struggled to accomplish the course and the capstone project
to my best knowledge.
